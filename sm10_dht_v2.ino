/* 
   SimpleModbusSlaveV10 supports function 3, 6 & 16.
   
   This example code will receive the adc ch0 value from the arduino master. 
   It will then use this value to adjust the brightness of the led on pin 9.
   The value received from the master will be stored in address 1 in its own
   address space namely holdingRegs[].
   
   In addition to this the slaves own adc ch0 value will be stored in 
   address 0 in its own address space holdingRegs[] for the master to
   be read. The master will use this value to alter the brightness of its
   own led connected to pin 9.
   
   The modbus_update() method updates the holdingRegs register array and checks
   communication.

   Note:  
   The Arduino serial ring buffer is 64 bytes or 32 registers.
   Most of the time you will connect the arduino to a master via serial
   using a MAX485 or similar.
 
   In a function 3 request the master will attempt to read from your
   slave and since 5 bytes is already used for ID, FUNCTION, NO OF BYTES
   and two BYTES CRC the master can only request 58 bytes or 29 registers.
 
   In a function 16 request the master will attempt to write to your 
   slave and since a 9 bytes is already used for ID, FUNCTION, ADDRESS, 
   NO OF REGISTERS, NO OF BYTES and two BYTES CRC the master can only write
   54 bytes or 27 registers.
 
   Using a USB to Serial converter the maximum bytes you can send is 
   limited to its internal buffer which differs between manufactures.
